## 2026-03-28: Fleet-wide automation regression — broken CSS variables + missing footers

**Problem:** A post-swarm-audit automation run injected `lovespark-tokens.css` and `lovespark-base.css` into popup.html, and replaced `--ls-pink-accent` with undefined `--ls-btn-bg` in popup.css. This broke toggle colors (rendered transparent) and changed disabled opacity from 0.4 to 0.9. Footer buttons were also missing from 26 extensions.
**Root cause:** Batch automation (`sync-shared-lib.sh` or swarm pass) overwrote extension CSS without validating variable definitions. The `--ls-btn-bg` variable was never defined in any CSS file.
**Fix:** Reverted all 76 git repos to last committed state. Fixed 3 extensions (cookie-nuke, breathe, planner) that had the bug baked into commits. Added footer buttons (LoveSpark Suite, Ko-fi, Report a Bug) to all 26 missing extensions. Updated shared lib footer to make LoveSpark Suite a proper link to lovespark.love. Deployed `guard-fleet-sync.sh` — 4-gate pre-sync validator that blocks automations introducing undefined CSS variables.
**Files:** popup.css, popup.html, lib/lovespark-footer.js, lib/lovespark-footer.css
**Commit:** fleet-wide fix, multiple commits

## 2026-07-09: Remove duplicate lovespark-tokens.css load from `popup.html` (fleet 2026-03-28 regression)

**Problem:** `popup.html` carried a direct reference to `lovespark-tokens.css` even though
`lovespark-base.css` (loaded by the same page) already `@import`s it — the token sheet
loaded twice. This is the fleet-wide 2026-03-28 injection regression; `guard-fleet-sync.sh`
Gate 4 blocks all fleet shared-lib syncs while any such reference exists in extension HTML.

**Fix:** Removed the redundant `<link>` (a one-line deletion; no other markup touched). Also refreshed `lib/lovespark-tokens.css` to the canonical
deterministic-header build (token values byte-identical to the 80/80-audited canonical;
shared-lib ITER-003 / lovespark-shared-lib@7690133) and bumped the manifest patch version.

**Verification:** zero `lovespark-tokens.css` references remain in this extension's HTML;
`origin/main`'s `lib/lovespark-base.css` confirmed to `@import url('lovespark-tokens.css')`,
so removal is cascade-neutral — zero visual change. Fleet guard Gate 4 green on the live
tree 2026-07-09; `ls-check` samples (lovespark-breathe 41 pass / 0 fail,
lovespark-task-anchor 42 pass / 0 fail) after the fleet-wide sync.
